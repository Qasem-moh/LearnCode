          What is CSS? CSS is the language for describing the presentation of
          Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt
          the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens,
          small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used
          with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS
          makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages,
          and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the
          separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.

          What is HTML? HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web
          pages. HTML gives authors the means to: Publish online documents with
          headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc. Retrieve online
          information via hypertext links, at the click of a button. Design
          forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in
          searching for information, making reservations, ordering products,
          etc. Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other
          applications directly in their documents. With HTML, authors describe
          the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language
          label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so
          on.

          What is XHTML? XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses the syntax of XML,
          the Extensible Markup Language. XHTML has all the same elements (for
          paragraphs, etc.) as the HTML variant, but the syntax is slightly
          different. Because XHTML is an XML application, you can use other XML
          tools with it (such as XSLT, a language for transforming XML content).

          What is scripting? A script is program code that doesn’t need
          pre-processing (e.g. compiling) before being run. In the context of a
          Web browser, scripting usually refers to program code written in
          JavaScript that is executed by the browser when a page is downloaded,
          or in response to an event triggered by the user. Scripting can make
          Web pages more dynamic. For example, without reloading a new version
          of a page it may allow modifications to the content of that page, or
          allow content to be added to or sent from that page. The former has
          been called DHTML (Dynamic HTML), and the latter AJAX (Asynchronous
          JavaScript and XML). Beyond this, scripts increasingly allow
          developers to create a bridge between the browser and the platform it
          is running on, making it possible, for example, to create Web pages
          that incorporate information from the user’s environment, such as
          current location, address book details, etc. This additional
          interactivity makes Web pages behave like a traditional software
          application. These Web pages are often called Web applications and can
          be made available either directly in the browser as a Web page, or can
          be packaged and distributed as Widgets.
